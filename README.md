This project explores whether given marginal probability distributions for set of observable random variables are compatible with a particular causal model called the triangle scenario.
[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00672.pdf) by Wolfe, Spekkens and Fritz discuss how incompatibility can be shown by instead considering inflated causal models.
The constraints derived from the causal structure can be formulated as a convex linear optimisation problem.
The Julia notebook inflation.ipynb explores the feasibility of the optimisation problem for various marginal probability distributions.

This project is submitted as the fourth assignment for the 2020 Computational Physics course at Perimeter Institute.
